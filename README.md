## My Process

I approached this project with a focus on creating a responsive and visually appealing social links profile using modern web technologies.

### Built With

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox for layout
- Responsive design using `clamp()` and viewport-relative units (vw)
- Google Fonts - Imported "Inter" font for typography styling

### What I Learned

Through this project, I reinforced my knowledge of semantic HTML, CSS layout techniques, and responsive design principles. Specifically:

- How to use `clamp()` for responsive margin and font sizes.
- Implementing CSS variables for consistent theming.
- Enhancing accessibility through semantic HTML elements.

### Continued Development

In future projects, I aim to further refine my skills in:

- Advanced CSS techniques such as CSS Grid for layout.
- JavaScript integration for interactive components.
- Improving accessibility and SEO practices in web development.
